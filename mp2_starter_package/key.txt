0) The binary result of quality assessment. 0 = bad quality 1 = sufficient quality.
1) The binary result of pre-screening, where 1 indicates severe retinal abnormality and 0 its lack.
2-7) The results of MA detection. Each feature value stand for the
number of MAs found at the confidence levels alpha = 0.5, . . . , 1, respectively.
8-15) contain the same information as 2-7) for exudates. However,
as exudates are represented by a set of points rather than the number of
pixels constructing the lesions, these features are normalized by dividing the
number of lesions with the diameter of the ROI to compensate different image
sizes.
16) The euclidean distance of the center of
the macula and the center of the optic disc to provide important information
regarding the patientâ€™s condition. This feature
is also normalized with the diameter of the ROI.
17) The diameter of the optic disc.
18) The binary result of the AM/FM-based classification.
